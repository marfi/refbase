About refbase
-------------
  refbase is a web-based solution for managing scientific literature,
  references and citations.
  
  Currently, the following features have been implemented for:
  EVERYONE
    - search the database using different search forms
    - search within results
    - browse found records and view selected records in detail
    - display rich text (i.e., italics, super/sub-script, greek letters)
    - extract citations from a text & build an appropriate reference list
    - track queries using RSS
    - a print-friendly view
    - display selected records in different citation styles & output formats
    - a webservice that allows clients to access a refbase database using a
      standard query syntax and retrieve results in structured XML format
    - search a refbase online database from the command line and retrieve
      results in various export & citation formats
  LOGGED IN USERS
    - user-specific fields which are stored individually for each user
    - display or search within only the user's own literature
    - export selected records to MODS XML, ODF XML and (via the GPLed bibutils
      programs) to BibTeX, EndNote, and RIS
    - import of records from common bibliographic formats and online databases
    - automatic email announcements for newly added records
    - save and recall search queries
    - adding records to user-specific groups
    - add/edit/delete records as well as file upload & download links
  ADMINISTRATOR
    - user management interface provided to the database admin
