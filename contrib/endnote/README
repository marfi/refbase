About
-----
  refbase-0.8.0 does not have a facility to import many references from desktop
  citation managers via a web interface.  A future version of refbase will have
  this feature, but this style file and php script will allow Endnote users to
  transfer data into refbase at the command line.

Use
---
  Part I: Endnote
  - Copy refbase.ens into your Endnote styles directory.
    On win32 systems, this is typically:
      C:\Program Files\Endnote\Styles
    On Mac systems, this is typically:
      Macintosh HD\Applications\EndNote
  - Open the Endnote file you wish to import into refbase.
  - Choose the refbase Output Syle
  - Export to endnote.txt
  Part II: PHP
  - 'php endnote2mysql.php' will produce 'import.txt'
  Part III: Check it!
  - As this is a preliminary script that has undergone little testing, it is
    suggested that you look at 'import.txt' in spreadsheet software.
  Part IV: MySQL
  - From within your MySQL command line interpreter (mysql -u root literature -p):
      LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "import.txt" INTO TABLE refs;
