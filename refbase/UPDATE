How to update?
--------------
Please follow the steps below to update an existing refbase-0.7 installation to
refbase-0.8.0:

- First of all, please make sure that you have a recent backup of your refbase
  MySQL database! This can be accomplished by issuing the following command from
  your shell:

    mysqldump DATABASE_NAME --complete-insert -uADMINUSER -p --flush-logs \
              --opt > refbase-backup.sql

  In the above line, replace DATABASE_NAME with the database name that you've
  specified for the variable '$databaseName' (in file 'db.inc') for refbase-0.7.
  Similarly, replace ADMINUSER with the name of the administrative user that has
  full access to the MySQL admin database.  As an example, if the variable
  '$databaseName' is set to "literature" and your administrative user is "root",
  the above line would read:

    mysqldump literature --complete-insert -uroot -p --flush-logs \
              --opt > refbase-backup.sql

  WARNING: If using MySQL 4.1.x, mysqldump's charset conversion may damage data.
           If necessary, set the charset option to 'latin1' to avoid the
           conversion.

- Backup your original 'db.inc' and 'ini.inc.php'.  refbase-0.8.0 should not
  overwrite these, as they have been moved to the subdirectory 'initialize'.

- Optionally backup your refbase-0.7 scripts.

- Move all refbase-0.8.0 files to your web directory.

- Open the file 'initialize/db.inc.php' in a text editor and re-enter the values
  from your old 'db.inc' file for the variables '$databaseName', '$username' and
  '$password'.

- Now, open a web browser and access the 'update.php' script by typing:

    <http://SERVER_ADDRESS/PATH_ON_SERVER/update.php>

   (where the string 'SERVER_ADDRESS' is replaced by your server name and
   'PATH_ON_SERVER' is the actual path to your refbase-0.8.0 web directory)

  This should bring up the update form.  Edit the contents of all text entry
  fields to match your server setup and supply the MySQL admin password, then
  click the 'Update' button to update the database.

  WIN32: The 'update.php' and 'install.php' scripts now work under Windows.  Be
         sure to set a password for the MySQL root user.  The path to MySQL is
         probably '/Program Files/MySQL/bin/mysql.exe' or
         '/wamp/mysql/bin/mysql.exe', depending on how you installed MySQL.

  This will add the MySQL tables that were added in 0.8.0 and alter existing
  tables to match the table design used by refbase-0.8.0. Your data should
  remain untouched by this operation.

- After you've successfully performed the update, please remove the files
  'update.php' & 'update.sql' (as well as 'install.php' & 'install.sql') from
  your web directory.
