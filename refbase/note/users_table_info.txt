- DATE format must be YYYY-MM-DD
- TIME format must be HH:MM:SS
- carriage returns *within* fields (ASCII character 11) must be replaced with a "UNIX return" (ASCII character 10) -> Search for:  (\x0B)  Replace with: \\n
- empty fields are indicated by \N -> Search for: (?<=\t|^)(?=\t|$)   Replace with: \\N
- character encoding: higher ASCII chars must be encoded as ISO-8859-1
