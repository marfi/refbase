How to install?
---------------
The following is just a (very) quick guide to installation:

- You'll need a web server and an existing PHP and MySQL installation.
  If you require help on installation of these packages please visit
  <http://httpd.apache.org/>, <http://www.php.net/> and
  <http://www.mysql.com/>.

- Move all files from within the 'files' directory to your web directory.

- Open the file 'db.inc' in a text editor and edit the values of the
  variables '$databaseName', '$username' and '$password' to fit your needs.
  (Note that you'll be able to use the refbase package without modifying
  these variables, but we highly recommend not to use the default values!)

- Now, open a web browser and access the 'install.php' script by typing:

    http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/PATH_ON_SERVER/install.php

   (where the string 'YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS' is replaced by your server
    name and 'PATH_ON_SERVER' is the actual path specification to your
    web directory)

  This should bring up the installation form. Edit the contents of all
  text entry fields to match your server setup and supply the MySQL
  admin password, then click the 'Install' button to install the
  database.



How to setup your own admin user?
---------------------------------

- After you've successfully installed the database (see above), open the
  main page ('index.php') and login with:

    email address  =  user@refbase.net
    password       =  start

  You should see now a welcome message at the top right corner of the page
  confirming your successful login.

- Click on 'Add User' which should bring up an empty form. At a minimum,
  you have to specify the admin's first name & last name, his institutional
  abbreviation as well as his email address and password. Then click the
  'Add User' button. You will be shown a receipt page with the account
  details you just entered.

- Now open the file 'ini.inc.php' in a text editor and change the value of
  the '$adminLoginEmail' variable to the email address you've specified for
  your new admin user.

- Log out from the database, then login again using the email address and
  password of your newly created admin account.

- You can now delete the initial user by choosing 'Manage Users' and
  clicking the appropriate trash icon. (However, we recommend to keep this
  user until you've explored the example records that come with the
  database)



How to configure the database?
------------------------------
In order to properly configure your database you'll need to edit the
global configuration file:

- Open the file 'ini.inc.php' & edit all values of the contained variables
  to fit your needs. Please see the comments within the file for further
  guidance.

  Especially note that if you've chosen 'utf8' (Unicode) as default character
  set on installation, you must re-save the file 'ini.inc.php' with Unicode
  encoding.



Rules for data import
---------------------
Some notes how to prepare data for upload into your newly created MySQL
tables:

- Fields are separated by tabs, records are separated by returns
  (if not specified otherwise within the LOAD DATA statement).

- The order of fields must resemble the field order specified in the
  MySQL table 'refs'. Field information for table 'refs' is given at:
  <http://sf.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=13388&group_id=64647>

- DATE format must be YYYY-MM-DD and TIME format must be HH:MM:SS.

- Carriage returns *within* fields must be represented by a newline
  character ('\n', ASCII character 10).

- Empty fields must be indicated by \N.

- Character encoding: higher ASCII chars must be encoded as ISO-8859-1
  aka 'Western (ISO Latin 1)'.

- File encoding must be UNIX.

- Assuming your data file is named 'refs.txt', you should be able to
  upload your data via use of the 'mysql' command line interpreter:

  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "/PATH/TO/FILE/refs.txt" INTO TABLE refs;

  or, alternatively, use something like the following from your shell:

  mysqlimport --local -u root -p YOUR_DB_NAME "/PATH/TO/FILE/refs.txt"
