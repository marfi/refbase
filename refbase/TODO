Suggestions for improving refbase:

* Data import from MODS XML and other common bibliographic formats, like
  BibTeX, EndNote, ISI Web of Science, RIS, and Pubmed XML.

* Enhanced export using bibutils to BibTex, EndNote, and RIS.

* Support for Unicode and the UTF8 international character set.

* Simplify manual data input by providing record type specific forms.
  These forms will guide a user by only showing those fields that are
  required for a particular record type (like journal articles, book
  chapters or whole books).

* Provide additional citation formats on export - preferably via the use
  of a plugin structure which would make it easy to add your own citation
  citation styles.

* User customization: provide a user specific preferences page where one
  can specify the default columns that are visible in query results or
  the default fields that are visible in particular search forms.

* Offer the user means for handling duplicate database entries.

* Validation of data entered by the user.

* Provide administrative interface to deleted records and user data.

* Enable remembering of marked records across different requests.

* More user-specific and record-specific rights management.
