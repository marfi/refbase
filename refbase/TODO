Suggestions for improving refbase:

- Data import from MODS XML and other common bibliographic formats, like BibTeX,
  EndNote, ISI Web of Science, RIS, and Pubmed XML.

- Provide additional citation formats, preferably via the use of a plugin
  structure which would make it easy to add your own citation citation styles.

- Simplify manual data input by providing record type specific forms.  These
  forms could guide a user by only showing those fields that are required for a
  particular record type (like journal articles, book chapters or whole books).

- Validation of data entered/imported by the user.

- Offer the user means for handling duplicate database entries..

- Provide administrative interface to deleted records.

- User customization: provide a user-specific preferences page where one can
  specify the default columns that are visible in query results or the default
  fields that are visible in particular search forms.

- Enable remembering of marked records across different requests.

- Cross-site searches (both through other copies of refbase and through other
  bibliographic databases).

- Improved export through both revisions to the current MODS XML/bibutils system
  and through adding more native export options which wouldn't require bibutils.

- More user-specific and record-specific rights management.
