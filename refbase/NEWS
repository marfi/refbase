refbase-0.8.0
-------------
[05-Apr-2005]

  Feature additions
-------------------

Installation:

- New 'update.php' script and 'update.sql' to update refbase-0.7 to 0.8.0.

- 'install.php' and 'update.php' both work on Windows servers.

Export/citation:

- Export to MODS XML: refbase can output records in MODS format, a bibliographic
  XML standard developed by the Library of Congress:
    <http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/>

- Export to Endnote/Bibtex/RIS: refbase supports export of records to common
  bibliographic formats by use of bibutils:
    <http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/software/bibutils/>

- User-specific cite keys: The new user-specific field "Cite Key" allows users
  to specify a custom identifier for each record.  Cite keys will be supported
  in export formats (MODS XML & Bibtex) and text citations as well as when
  generating reference lists.

Adding/editing/deleting of records:

- Unicode support: You can now set the default character set to 'utf8' (Unicode)
  when installing refbase on MySQL 4.1.x or greater.  This provides support for
  double-byte languages.

- RSS support: Users can now track queries using RSS, i.e. users are able to
  convert any query into a dynamic RSS feed and subscribe to it using their
  favorite news aggregator.  The feed will display all newly added records
  matching the users query.
  
- Print view: Added a print-friendly view which eases printing or copying of
  records.

- Includes an Endnote style file and PHP script to ease the manual batch import
  of bibliographic records.
  
- Started localization: Provided core structure to support web interfaces in
  different languages.  Note that the localization feature isn't finished nor
  enabled yet and will be available in a future release.

Admin features:

- User-specific permissions: The admin can now assign access rights individually
  for each user.  Permission settings are provided for basic actions like
  add/edit/delete records or file upload/download as well as other features like
  import, export or cite.

- Reference types, citation styles and export formats can be enabled/disabled by
  the admin for each user individually.  The user, in turn, can choose which of
  the enabled types/styles/formats shall be visible.

- User- and criteria-specific file downloads: Download links can be made
  available to either everyone, logged-in users only or on a user-specific
  basis.  In addition, you can optionally specify a condition where files will
  be always made visible.

- The admin interface now allows to group particular database users.

User customization:

- User-specific groups: Users can now add records to user-specific groups.  A
  drop-down menu on the main page (or any search results list) provides quick
  access to all records belonging to a particular group.

- Saved queries: It is now possible to permanently save any search query
  together with the current display settings. Saved queries can be easily
  recalled or edited from the main page.

- Link records: A new user-specific field ("Related") enables users to link
  records to other records in the database.  Links can be either static (by
  explicitly linking to particular record serials) or dynamic (by entering
  queries like "author:lee; title:ecosystem").


  Changes
---------

- The MySQL database used by refbase has undergone some significant changes.
  Please use the 'update.php' script to update any old refbase MySQL database.

- refbase will now work independent of the 'register_globals' setting in your
  PHP configuration file 'php.ini'.

- Links to particular pages/features will be only made visible if the user has
  appropriate access rights.

- Re-designed the "Search within Results" form.

- Users can now choose on every search results page which fields and how many
  records shall be displayed.

- Logged-in users can now use user-specific cite keys (instead of serial
  numbers) as record identifiers when generating a reference list using
  'extract.php'.

- Citation style and export format definitions now reside in individual files
  (within the 'cite/' and 'export/' sub-directories, respectively) and are
  managed via MySQL tables.  This enables users to develop custom styles and/or
  formats.

- Added support for fields 'keywords', 'notes', 'marked' and 'language' within
  the admin interface.

- Custom CSS style sheets can be specified within 'ini.inc.php' to change the
  visual appearance of the served web pages.

- You can now define (in 'initialize/ini.inc.php') what will be searched by
  script 'library_search.php'.

- Added variables to the database configuration file ('initialize/db.inc.php')
  which allow to use custom names for the refbase MySQL tables.

- Renamed the v0.7 'Export' feature to 'Cite' to better reflect its purpose and
  to make room for the new export capabilities.

- Include files and configuration files were moved to separate sub-directories.

- refbase now tries harder to prevent a malicious user from hacking the database
  by use of a custom SQL query.

- A lot of internal code re-structuring.


  Bug fixes
-----------

- When adding records, entered values will be reloaded correctly if an error
  occurs.




refbase-0.7
-----------
[11-Jan-2004]

  Feature additions
-------------------

Installation:

- Provided a web interface ('install.php') as well as a MySQL dump file for
  installation.  This should make it a lot easier to setup the database.
  Besides the database structure, the MySQL dump file includes a temporary
  admin user and twelve sample records.

User customization:

- The database now offers six user-specific fields.  These fields are stored
  individually for each user within a separate table.  You can use these fields
  to store personal information for a particular record (for example your
  personal keywords or notes).  These fields are only provided to logged-in
  users and can't be viewed by other users.

- After login, a 'Show My Refs' form will allow you to easily display all of
  your own literature.  This form also offers a quick way of searching your own
  literature by your personal fields (such as your personal keywords or notes).

Display features:

- Provided display support for rich text (like italics, super-/subscript or
  greek symbols) within the title, keywords and abstract fields by use of a
  configurable, extensible and human readable markup syntax.

- A direct download link to any file that's associated with a particular
  record will be shown to logged in users.

- By default, exported records will now feature a 'show details' link to the
  right.

- Export output can now optionally list records in blocks sorted by year.

- Provided support for custom header messages within database queries: by
  including the 'headerMsg' parameter within query URLs it is now possible to
  include any information string within a link.  As an example, a query URL
  pointing to articles written by a particular author can now include the
  appropriate author information (e.g. "Articles by Matthias Steffens:") which
  will show up as a header message on every results page.

User management:

- 'Search within Results' functionality now also works when managing users.

- It is now possible to delete any non-admin user via the user management
  interface.

- Two new fields will store information about the date & time of the last login
  as well as the total number of logins for a particular user.

Admin features:

- The admin user is allowed to execute custom SQL statements other than SELECT
  queries (according to his GRANT privileges).  This will enable him to make
  batch changes to the database.

Adding/editing/deleting of records: 

- Added record announcement capabilities: If a new record has been added to the
  database a short email announcement can be sent to a mailing list email
  address.

- Provided some magic that figures out what do to depending on the state of the
  new 'is Editor' check box and the content of the 'author', 'editor' and 'type'
  fields.

- Introduced a new field 'thesis' which enables you to specify the type of
  degree ("Bachelor's thesis", "Master's thesis", "Ph.D. thesis", "Diploma
  thesis", "Doctoral thesis" or "Habilitation thesis") that was achieved by a
  publication.

- Provided support for online publications by the introduction of two new
  database fields: 'online_publication' & 'online_citation'.  If the field
  'online_publication' is set to 'yes' by marking the appropriate checkbox, the
  export view will display the doi number as well as any string that was entered
  into the 'online_citation' field.

- Introduced a new field 'contribution_id'.  By marking the appropriate checkbox
  within the 'record' form your institutional abbreviation will be added to the
  contents of the 'contribution_id' field.  This serves as an easy method to tag
  all those records that were published by your own institution.

- 'record.php' now enables you to upload a file that's associated with a
  particular record entry.  If the root directory where your files will be
  stored (specified in 'ini.inc.php') contains a sub-directory whose name
  matches the string provided within the 'abbrev_journal' field (after
  converting the string to lowercase and stripping all characters but ascii
  letters) the uploaded file will be placed inside that sub-directory.  As an
  example, if you've created a sub-directory named 'polarbiol' within your files
  root directory, any uploaded file will be copied to that sub-directory if its
  accompanying record contains the string 'Polar Biol.' within its
  'abbrev_journal' field.

- Depending on the value of the 'locationSelector' drop-down, the user's name and
  email address will be added/removed from the 'location' field automatically.


  Changes
---------

- The format of the MySQL tables has changed (added & renamed some fields and
  changed some field types).  You'll need to update your table definitions in
  order to use this version!  See the online documentation for further help:
    <http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=64647>

- File 'db.inc': Removed 'root' as default value for '$username' (the use of a
  separate mysql user with more restrictive permissions is highly recommended).

- Non-admin users will be only shown their own call number information.  This is
  done to ease data entry and to prevent non-admin users from messing with other
  user's call number information.  The data entered by the user will be
  automatically completed with the user's correct call number prefix.

- Instead of deleting data, deleted records will now be moved to the 'deleted'
  table.  Data will be stored within the 'deleted' table until they are removed
  manually.  This is to provide the admin with a simple recovery method in case
  a user did delete some data by accident.


  Bug fixes
-----------

- Fixed a (potentially disastrous) security hole where non-admin users were
  allowed to execute custom queries other than SELECT queries.

- When adding/updating a record the fields 'created_date', 'created_time',
  'created_by', 'modified_date', 'modified_time', 'modified_by' will be set
  correctly now.

- Similarly, when adding/updating a record, the calculation fields
  'first_author', 'author_count' and 'first_page' will be setup correctly now.

- Modifying the SQL query of a particular search result now also works properly
  for details and export view.

The following known issues have been fixed:

- If you clicked on login/logout within the first of any query results pages
  before clicking somewhere else, you did get an 'Error 1065: Query was empty'.

- Export as 'Text Citation' didn't work properly on records that were added via
  the web interface.




refbase-0.6.1b1
---------------
[30-Jun-2003]

- Fixes a bug which made it impossible to setup the first user of the database.

- A user management interface is provided to admins.

- Users can now change their password later on.

- Variable settings from 'ini.inc.php' are now honoured correctly.

- Provided a search form that shows up on the main page after successful login
  which will allow a user to easily search his *own* literature only.
