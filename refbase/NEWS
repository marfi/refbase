refbase-0.7
-----------
[11-Jan-2004]

  Feature additions
-------------------

Installation:

- Provided a web interface ('install.php') as well as a MySQL dump
  file for installation. This should make it a lot easier to setup
  the database. Besides the database structure, the MySQL dump file
  includes a temporary admin user as well as twelve sample records.

User customization:

- The database now offers six user specific fields. These fields are
  stored individually for each user within a separate table. You can
  use these fields to store personal information for a particular
  record, for example your personal keywords or notes. These fields
  are only provided to logged in users and can't be viewed by other
  users.

- After login, a 'Show My Refs' form will allow you to easily
  display all of your own literature. This form also offers a quick
  way of searching your own literature by your personal fields (such
  as your personal keywords or notes).

Display features:

- Provided display support for rich text (like italics, super-/
  subscript or greek symbols) within the title, keywords and abstract
  fields by use of a configurable, extensible and human readable markup
  syntax.

- A direct download link to any file that's associated with a
  particular record will be shown to logged in users.

- By default, exported records will now feature a 'show details'
  link to the right.

- Export output can now optionally list records in blocks sorted by
  year.

- Provided support for custom header messages within database queries:
  By including the 'headerMsg' parameter within query URLs it is now
  possible to include any information string within a link. As an
  example, a query URL pointing to articles written by a particular
  author can now include the appropriate author information (e.g.
  "Articles by Matthias Steffens:") which will show up as a header
  message on every results page.

User management:

- 'Search within Results' functionality now also works when managing
  users.

- It is now possible to delete any non-admin user via the user
  management interface.

- Two new fields will store information about the date & time of the
  last login as well as the total number of logins for a particular
  user.

Admin features:

- The admin user is allowed to execute custom SQL statements other
  than SELECT queries (according to his GRANT privileges). This will
  enable him to make batch changes to the database, e.g., update or
  delete multiple records at once.

Adding/editing/deleting of records: 

- Added record announcement capabilities: if a new record has been
  added to the database a short email announcement can be sent to a
  mailing list email address.

- Provided some magic that figures out what do to depending on the
  state of the new 'is Editor' check box and the content of the
  'author', 'editor' and 'type' fields.

- Introduced a new field 'thesis' which enables you to specify
  the type of degree ("Bachelor's thesis", "Master's thesis",
  "Ph.D. thesis", "Diploma thesis", "Doctoral thesis" or
  "Habilitation thesis") that was achieved by a publication.

- Provided support for online publications by the introduction of two
  new database fields: 'online_publication' & 'online_citation'. If
  the field 'online_publication' is set to 'yes' by marking the
  appropriate checkbox, the export view will display the doi number
  as well as any string that was entered into the 'online_citation'
  field.

- Introduced a new field 'contribution_id'. By marking the appropriate
  checkbox within the 'record' form your institutional abbreviation
  will be added to the contents of the 'contribution_id' field. This
  serves as an easy method to tag all those records that were published
  by your own institution.

- 'record.php' now enables you to upload a file that's associated with a
  particular record entry. If the root directory where your files will
  be stored (specified in 'ini.inc.php') contains a sub-directory whose
  name matches the string provided within the 'abbrev_journal' field
  (after converting the string to lowercase and stripping all characters
  but ascii letters) the uploaded file will be placed inside that
  sub-directory. As an example, if you've created a sub-directory named
  'polarbiol' within your files root directory, any uploaded file will
  be copied to that sub-directory if its accompanying record contains
  the string 'Polar Biol.' within its 'abbrev_journal' field.

- Depending on the value of the 'locationSelector' popup, the user's
  name and email address will be added/removed from the 'location'
  field automatically.


  Changes
---------

- The format of the MySQL tables has changed (added & renamed some
  fields and changed some field types). You'll need to update your
  table definitions in order to use this version! See the online
  documentation for further help:
  
    <http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=64647>

- File 'db.inc': removed 'root' as default value for '$username'.
  Instead, the use of a separate mysql user with more restrictive
  permissions is highly recommended.

- Non-admin users will be only shown their own call number information.
  This is done to ease data entry and to prevent non-admin users
  from messing with other user's call number information. The data
  entered by the user will be automatically completed with the
  user's correct call number prefix.

- Instead of deleting data, deleted records will now be moved to the
  'deleted' table. Data will be stored within the 'deleted' table until
  they are removed manually. This is to provide the admin with a simple
  recovery method in case a user did delete some data by accident.


  Bug fixes
-----------

- Fixed a (potentially disastrous) security hole where non-admin
  users were allowed to execute custom queries other than SELECT
  queries.

- When adding/updating a record the fields 'created_date',
  'created_time', 'created_by', 'modified_date', 'modified_time',
  'modified_by' will be set correctly now.

- Similarly, when adding/updating a record, the calculation fields
  'first_author', 'author_count' and 'first_page' will be setup
  correctly now.

- Modifying the SQL query of a particular search result now also works
  properly for details and export view.

The following known issues have been fixed:

- If you clicked on login/logout within the first of any query results
  pages *before* clicking somewhere else, you did get an 'Error 1065:
  Query was empty'.

- Export as 'Text Citation' didn't work properly on records that
  were added via the web interface.




refbase-0.6.1b1
---------------
[30-Jun-2003]

- Circumvents a very stupid bug where it wasn't possible to setup
  the very first user of the database (see the readme for details!).

- A user management interface is provided to admins.

- Users can now change their password later on.

- Variable settings from 'ini.inc.php' are now honoured correctly.

- Provided a search form that shows up on the main page after
  successful login which will allow a user to easily search his *own*
  literature only (note that this functionality is still preliminary!).
