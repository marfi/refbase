We are aware of the following problems, bugs and/or limitations:

* Currently, the simple and advanced search forms employ lots of
  dynamic popup menus to ease user entry of data. This works well for
  small databases (<10.000 records) but may cause significant speed
  problems for larger databases!

* Currently, there's no support of transactions! This means that two
  users will be able to edit the same record at the same time, which
  will cause unpredictable results. So, until we have a functional
  support of transactions, please remember to reload record data if
  you kept a record's "edit" form open for a longer period of time.

* the 'allow_edit_call_number' permission setting isn't honoured yet

* refbase does currently not attempt to rename uploaded files
  according to some standardized scheme. Instead, file names are
  taken as defined by the user. Plus, refbase won't check if a file
  with this file name exists already. I.e., if a user uploads a file
  with a name that equals the name of an existing file, the existing
  file will be overwritten. The problem will be addressed in a future
  release.
