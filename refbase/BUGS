We are aware of the following problems, bugs and/or limitations:

- The simple and advanced search forms employ lots of dynamic drop-down menus to
  ease user entry of data.  This works well for small databases (<10,000
  records) but may cause significant speed problems for larger databases!

- There's no support for transactions.  This means that multiple users will be
  able to edit the same record at the same time.   This will usually cause the
  record to be overwritten by the last submitter, but it could cause surprising
  results.  Please remember to reload record data if you kept a record's "edit"
  form open for a long period of time.

- The 'allow_edit_call_number' permission setting isn't honoured yet.

- The process of internationalization and localization has not been completed yet.
