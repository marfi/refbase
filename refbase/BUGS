We are aware of the following problems, bugs and/or limitations:

* Currently, the simple and advanced search forms employ lots of
  dynamic popup menus to ease user entry of data. This works well for
  small databases (<10.000 records) but may cause significant speed
  problems for larger databases!

* Currently, there's no support of transactions! This means that two
  users will be able to edit the same record at the same time, which
  will cause unpredictable results. So, until we have a functional
  support of transactions, please remember to reload record data if
  you kept a record's "edit" form open for a longer period of time.

* If you delete a particular record, the database won't check if this
  record belongs to other users as well. This will be addressed in a
  future release.

* When adding a new record, your data won't get reloaded after a
  validation error occurred. As a work around, please use the back
  button of your browser to regain access to your record data.
