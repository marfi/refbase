We are aware of the following problems, bugs and/or limitations:

- The simple and advanced search forms employ lots of dynamic drop-down menus to
  ease user entry of data.  This works well for small databases (<10,000
  records) but may cause significant speed problems for larger databases!

- There's no support for transactions.  This means that multiple users will be
  able to edit the same record at the same time.   This will usually cause the
  record to be overwritten by the last submitter, but it could cause surprising
  results.  Please remember to reload record data if you kept a record's "edit"
  form open for a long period of time.

- The 'allow_edit_call_number' permission setting isn't honoured yet.

- refbase does currently not attempt to rename uploaded files.  Uploading a file
  with the same name as a file already on the server will overwrite it.  This
  will be addressed in the future by implementing a standard renaming scheme.

- The 'type' drop-down in details view doesn't show the correct record type if the
  type isn't among those types that were enabled by the admin and chosen to be
  visible by the user.
