About refbase
-------------
  refbase is a web-based solution for managing scientific literature,
  references and citations.  Currently, the following features have been
  implemented for:
  EVERYONE
    - search the database using different search forms
    - search within results
    - browse found records and view selected records in detail
    - display rich text (i.e. italics, super/sub-script, greek letters)
    - extract literature cited within a text
    - track queries using RSS
    - a print-friendly view
    - display the selected records in different citation formats
  LOGGED IN USERS
    - user specific fields which are stored individually for each user
    - display or search within only the user's own literature
    - export selected records to MODS XML and (via the freely available
      bibutils utilities) to BibTex, EndNote, and RIS
    - automatic email announcements for newly added records
    - save and recall search queries
    - adding records to user-specific groups
    - add/edit/delete records as well as file upload & download links
    - import of full records from Cambridge Scientific Abstracts
  ADMINISTRATOR
    - user management interface provided to the database admin
    - localization for different languages (currently English and German)
