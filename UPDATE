Please follow the steps below to update an existing refbase-0.8.0 installation
to refbase-0.9.0. The update script should also be able to update any refbase
version that was installed from CVS prior to the release of refbase-0.9.0. To
update versions of refbase prior to refbase-0.8.0, please update to
refbase-0.8.0 first.

- First of all, please make sure that you have a recent backup of your refbase
  MySQL database! This can be accomplished by issuing the following command from
  your shell:

    mysqldump DATABASE_NAME -uADMINUSER -p --complete-insert \
              --opt > refbase-backup.sql

  In the above line, replace DATABASE_NAME with the database name that you've
  specified for the variable '$databaseName' (in file 'initialize/db.inc.php')
  for refbase-0.8.0. Similarly, replace ADMINUSER with the name of the
  administrative user that has full access to the MySQL admin database. As an
  example, if the variable '$databaseName' is set to "literature" and your
  administrative user is "root", the above line would read:

    mysqldump literature -uroot -p --complete-insert \
              --opt > refbase-backup.sql

  WARNING: If using MySQL 4.1.x, mysqldump's charset conversion may damage data.
           If necessary, set the charset option to 'latin1' to avoid the
           conversion. More info is available at <http://backup.refbase.net>

- Backup your original configuration files 'initialize/db.inc.php' and
  'initialize/ini.inc.php'.

- Optionally backup your refbase-0.8.0 scripts.

- Move all refbase-0.9.0 files to your web directory.

- Open the file 'initialize/db.inc.php' in a text editor and re-enter the values
  from your old 'db.inc.php' file for the variables '$databaseName', '$username'
  and '$password'. Similarly, migrate all custom values that you've entered
  within the old 'ini.inc.php' file to the new one.

- Now, open a web browser and access the 'update.php' script by typing:

    <http://SERVER_ADDRESS/PATH_ON_SERVER/update.php>

   (where the string 'SERVER_ADDRESS' is replaced by your server name and
    'PATH_ON_SERVER' is the actual path to your refbase-0.9.0 web directory)

  This should bring up the update form. Edit the contents of all text entry
  fields to match your server setup and supply the MySQL admin password, then
  click the 'Update' button to update the database.

  WIN32: Be sure to set a password for the MySQL root user.

  This will add the MySQL tables that were added in 0.9.0 and alter existing
  tables to match the table design used by refbase-0.9.0. A detailed log is
  generated for all performed update actions. Your data should remain untouched
  by this operation.

- After you've successfully performed the update, please remove the files
  'update.php' & 'update.sql' (as well as 'install.php' & 'install.sql') from
  your web directory.

- Note: The update process modifies some existing formats in table 'formats' and
  adds additional ones. Please login as admin and make sure that suitable
  import, export and citation formats are enabled for all of your users within
  the "Display Options" section of the admin interface.
